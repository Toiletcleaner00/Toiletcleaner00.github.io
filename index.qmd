## About Me

![My Favourite Dog](dog2.jpg "Dog")

Hello! I'm Bryan, a passionate learner and explorer with a strong interest in technology, creativity, and problem-solving. I'm currently studying at **Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT)**, where I'm pursuing my academic and professional growth in a hands-on, application-driven environment.

From coding and software development to data analysis and AI tools, I enjoy diving deep into technical challenges and building meaningful projects. This website serves as a space to showcase my journey, projects, and interests outside of the classroom.

I created this website not only to document my learning experiences but also to share the things I enjoyâ€”from personal hobbies to tech experiments and reflections on new tools like Generative AI.

Whether you're here to check out my work, get inspired by my favorite movie, or see what I'm currently learningâ€”thank you for stopping by!
