# Pencil Drawing

## Why I Enjoy It
Drawing with pencils has always been a relaxing and rewarding hobby for me. I enjoy the level of control and precision it offers, and how something as simple as a graphite pencil can be used to create detailed, expressive artwork. It's a creative outlet that helps me slow down, focus, and observe the world more closely.

## Tools I Use
- **Graphite Pencils**: Ranging from 9H (hardest) to 9B (softest) for different textures and shading
- **Mechanical Pencils**: For fine details and line consistency
- **Erasers**:
  - *Kneaded Eraser*: For subtle lightening and highlights
  - *Vinyl Eraser*: For clean, precise erasing
- **Blending Tools**:
  - *Tortillons* and *Blending Stumps* for smooth gradients
  - *Cotton Swabs* and *Tissue* for broader blending
- **Sketchbook**: Acid-free, medium-to-heavyweight paper with slight texture
- **Fixative Spray**: To preserve finished drawings and prevent smudging

## Techniques I Practice
1. **Shading & Gradient Control**  
   Practicing smooth transitions from light to dark to create volume and depth.

2. **Hatching & Cross-Hatching**  
   Using lines and layered strokes to build tonal value and texture.

3. **Contour Drawing**  
   Focusing on the outline of subjects to capture form and proportion accurately.

4. **Reference Drawing**  
   Drawing from life or photographs to improve observation and realism.

5. **Texturing**  
   Developing techniques to render materials like skin, fabric, hair, and metal using pencil strokes.

6. **Negative Space Drawing**  
   Focusing on drawing the space around an object to improve spatial awareness and composition.

## Challenges Faced
- **Achieving Realism**: It can be difficult to balance detail without overworking a drawing.
- **Smudging**: Graphite easily smudges, requiring careful hand positioning and occasional fixative application.
- **Proportions & Perspective**: Maintaining accurate anatomy and depth, especially in portraits and architecture.
- **Time Management**: Pencil drawing can be time-consuming, especially for high-detail pieces.

## Personal Outcomes
- Improved hand-eye coordination and observation skills
- Deeper appreciation for light, form, and visual storytelling
- A growing portfolio of artworks that reflect my progress
- A relaxing and screen-free creative practice I can return to anytime
