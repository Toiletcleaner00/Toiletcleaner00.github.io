For example, when I needed help writing this page, ChatGPT gave me a well-structured draft to build on.\n\n\n\n\n\nTime-saving: I spent less time searching for documentation because I could ask direct questions.\nLearning Aid: It explained not only the “what” but also the “why,” helping me understand the reasoning behind the solutions.\nCreativity Support: It offered ideas and phrasing suggestions that made my writing clearer and more engaging.\n\n\n\n\n\nOver-reliance Risk: It’s tempting to just copy-paste answers without fully understanding them.
