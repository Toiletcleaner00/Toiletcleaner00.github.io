## Reflection on the use of GenAI

Using Generative AI (GenAI) tools like ChatGPT has been a unique and eye-opening experience throughout this assessment. I chose to use ChatGPT by OpenAI because of its flexibility, speed, and ability to assist in both technical and creative tasks.

### How GenAI Helped

The GenAI tool helped me in multiple ways:

- **Clarifying Instructions**: When I wasn’t sure how to format YAML files or structure `.qmd` pages, ChatGPT explained the correct syntax and caught errors like indentation or missing keys.
- **Fixing Code**: It quickly helped debug my Quarto configuration and provided corrected Markdown and HTML code for embedding links and images properly.
- **Improving Content**: I asked for help in refining my writing and organizing my reflections logically. For example, when I needed help writing this page, ChatGPT gave me a well-structured draft to build on.

### Benefits of GenAI Tools

- **Time-saving**: I spent less time searching for documentation because I could ask direct questions.
- **Learning Aid**: It explained not only the “what” but also the “why,” helping me understand the reasoning behind the solutions.
- **Creativity Support**: It offered ideas and phrasing suggestions that made my writing clearer and more engaging.

### Challenges Encountered

- **Over-reliance Risk**: It’s tempting to just copy-paste answers without fully understanding them. I had to make sure I still learned and reviewed the material myself.
- **Accuracy Checks**: Sometimes the responses need verification, especially when dealing with code or specific formatting requirements.

### Looking Ahead

In the future, I believe GenAI tools will be valuable companions in both academic and professional settings. They can support brainstorming, research, writing, coding, and even learning new skills—provided they’re used responsibly.

### Final Thoughts

Using GenAI has not only helped me complete the assessment efficiently but also taught me how to collaborate with a new type of digital assistant. I see it as a tool to amplify human creativity and productivity, not replace it.
